We will make use of the <strong>Notification API</strong>

<strong>Notification API: The Notification interface of the Notifications API is used to configure and display desktop notifications to the user. These notifications' appearance and specific functionality vary across platforms but generally they provide a way to asynchronously provide information to the user.</strong>

<i>Note: The notification API is not the same as the Push API</i>.
